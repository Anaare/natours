# Natours 🌍

A full-stack web application for browsing and booking nature tours. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose, while the frontend was recreated from the original Pug template into a modern React/TypeScript application for a more dynamic and component-based UI.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anaare/natours.git
   cd natours
   ```
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create Backend Environment Variables:

   - Create a config.env file inside the /backend folder.

   ```env
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE=your_mongodb_connection_string
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_db_password

   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=90d
   JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRES_IN=90

   EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email_username
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
   EMAIL_HOST=your_host
   EMAIL_PORT=your_port
   ```

4. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

5. Run the app (frontend and backend together):

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open your browser to http://localhost:5173

## Notes

- This project is based on the Natours app from Jonas Schmedtmann’s Node.js course.
- I rebuilt the entire frontend UI from Pug templates into a modern React/TypeScript application to make the project more scalable and maintainable.
- The backend structure follows the original MVC layout, with improvements where needed.
